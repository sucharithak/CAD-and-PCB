# CAD-and-PCB
I created this repository to show the CAD and PCB designs I made during my student life as a hiwi. 
This work was done over a span of few years.
I have learnt and unlearnt doing designs under many informative tutors, a.k.a my PHD and postdoc colleagues from the labs I have worked.
The main motivation in creating this repository is to inclue all my designs at a single place so that I can put a link in my CV.
